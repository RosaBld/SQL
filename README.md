# SQL Learning

In this repo, you'll find a bunch of exercices allowing us to learn the basics of SQL and databases.

There are 4 main exercices and a Group Project.

## MySQL_BASICS

After adding a databases in PHPmyAdmin, given by the coach of BeCode, this exercice had the goal of teaching us to use the basics commands to retrieve and consume different informations.

## Crud1 & Crud2

These two exercices have the main purpose which is to learn how to create and use a form. Like the last one, the database was given and the main goal was to learn how to create the link between the database and the webpage and to learn how to retrieve the data and display them, and how to add new data.

## Hiking

Like the other ones, the database was given and the main goal was to learn how to create the link between the database and the webpage and to learn how to retrieve the data and display them, and how to add new data.

## Weather_App2

The Weather_App2 is a new version of the [WeatherApp](https://github.com/RosaBld/WeatherApp)!. Again, the Database was given by the coach. Again, the goal was to display those datas and create a form allowing us to enter new datas (weather related).

## Groupe Project - Pokedex
